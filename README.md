# Project Title
React Phone Catalog

## Description
A site designed to sell phones. The site has common features such as:
- Filtering and the ability to share them via URL.
- A list of favorites.
- A cart.
- The possibility to order with Nova Post delivery.

## Installation
1. Clone this repo
2. Run ```npm i```
3. In folder `.husky` you should create a file `pre-commit` with text: `npx lint-staged`

##### Third step adds action which runs Linter and Prettier before each commit. In case of unfixable error it stops commit.

### Usage
- To start the project run `npm start`
- To check and fix some errors `npm run lint`
- To check and fix code style `npm run format`
- To run localhost properly add `#/` after `http://localhost:5173/react_phone-catalog/`

### **_Before each push and pull your code will be checked by_ `Lint` _and_ `Prettier`.**
### **_Also there is a remote_ `Lint` _test_**
